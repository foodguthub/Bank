The Bank is located in a community fridge at [Hackerspace.sg](http://hackerspace.sg/) - check if someone's in and come get some starters. Don't forget to leave something in exchange - if you don't have any starters to deposit, just share whatever you can: recipe, cake, code, beer, song, joke, old hardware or anything else that you yourself consider worth sharing is welcomed. **KrautSource!**

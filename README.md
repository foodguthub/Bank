# Bank
Fermentation Bank is a public ledger of starter cultures: free to deposit, free to withdraw. But sharing is caring: you take, you give. Anything you have.

The Bank is located in a fridge at [Hackerspace.sg](http://hackerspace.sg/) - check if someone's in and come swap some starters. If you want to take some, but don't have any for exchange yet, just share whatever you have: any skills, talents, knowledge, hardware or tools are welcomed. **KrautSource!**

## Simply:

* **1. Take something, give something** 

    Information, tips, skills, recipes, cultures, ferments, pictures, jokes, poems, workshops etc
    
* **2. Be creative in participating**

    Share knowledge, ideas, services, donations, tech support and volunteer
    
* **3. Bacteria and humans play nice**

    No invasive species, no hateful speech or behaviour will be tolerated
    
* **4. Spread the love**

    (and bacteria)
